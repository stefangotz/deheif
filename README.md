## Development

Improvements to the code are most welcome.

To get started with this Python project, note that it relies on a number of fairly common Python tools to improve the development experience, first and foremost being *poetry*.
The script `tools/setup.sh` contains the instructions to initialise a development environment for this project.
If on Windows, try running it from a *git bash* session or simply run the commands it contains on the command prompt or a powershell session.
